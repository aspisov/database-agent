# PostgreSQL AI Agent: Design Document

## 1. Problem Definition

### 1.1 Origin
The PostgreSQL AI Agent is designed to address the challenge of database interaction for users without SQL expertise. Traditional database interactions require users to write SQL queries, which can be a significant barrier for non-technical users who need to extract insights from their data. This agent aims to bridge this gap by allowing users to interact with PostgreSQL databases using natural language.

### 1.2 Relevance and Reasons
- **Technical Barrier Reduction**: Many business users need database insights but lack SQL knowledge
- **Productivity Enhancement**: Reduces time spent on query formulation and debugging
- **Democratization of Data**: Makes database access more inclusive across organizations
- **Error Reduction**: Minimizes syntax errors common in manual SQL writing
- **Visualization Capabilities**: Enables quick data visualization without additional tools

### 1.3 Previous Work
Several existing solutions attempt to address this problem:
- **Pandas AI**: Provides natural language interface for pandas dataframes
- **SQL Copilots**: Assist with SQL writing but still require technical knowledge
- **BI Tools**: Offer visualization but with limited flexibility and high setup costs

Our solution differentiates by:
- Direct integration with PostgreSQL databases
- Specialized agents for different query types
- Built-in visualization capabilities
- Conversational context awareness

### 1.4 Other Issues and Risks
- **Security Concerns**: Ensuring the system doesn't expose sensitive data
- **Query Performance**: Preventing inefficient queries that could impact database performance
- **Accuracy of Translations**: Ensuring natural language is correctly translated to SQL
- **User Trust**: Building confidence in the system's outputs
- **Scalability**: Handling complex database schemas and large datasets

## 2. Goals and Antigoals

### 2.1 Goals
- Create a natural language interface for PostgreSQL databases
- Accurately translate user questions into optimized SQL queries
- Generate useful visualizations from query results
- Maintain context across conversation turns
- Provide explanations for generated queries
- Support a wide range of SQL operations (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.)
- Ensure security and data privacy

### 2.2 Antigoals
- **NOT** a replacement for database administrators
- **NOT** designed to handle database administration tasks (backups, user management)
- **NOT** optimized for extremely complex analytical queries
- **NOT** a general-purpose chatbot
- **NOT** a tool for writing DDL statements or modifying database structure
- **NOT** focused on supporting databases other than PostgreSQL

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with specialized components:

1. **Central Query Router**: Analyzes user queries and routes them to specialized agents
2. **Text2SQL Agent**: Converts natural language to SQL
3. **Visualization Agent**: Creates visual representations of data
4. **Chat Agent**: Handles general conversational queries
5. **PostgreSQL Connector**: Securely executes queries against the database
6. **Streamlit UI**: Provides a user-friendly interface

  - Result display
  - Visualization rendering
- **Interfaces**:
  - Input: User interactions
  - Output: Visual presentation of system responses

### 3.3 Data Flow
1. User enters a natural language query in the UI
2. Query Router analyzes the query and routes to appropriate agent
3. Agent processes the query (generates SQL, creates visualization, or responds conversationally)
4. For database queries, PostgreSQL Connector executes the query
5. Results are formatted and returned to the UI
6. UI displays results to the user
